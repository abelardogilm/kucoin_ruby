# KuCoin API Client

A Ruby client for the [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=E57fFl/) API.

## Overview

This Ruby Gem attempts to add a layer to communicate with [KuCoin API documentation](http://docs.kucoinapidocs.apiary.io/) making easy connect with it. 31 endpoits are implemented but some of them
are not working correctly yet

## Getting started

### Installation

Add gem to your Gemfile
`gem 'kucoin_ruby'`

Some of API endpoints are open, like exchange or market information.
No credentials are required to use them, but if you want to use private endpoints
you will need to define your KuCoin **API credentials** as ENV vars of your project:

```
KUCOIN_KEY=YOUR_KEY
KUCOIN_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
```
